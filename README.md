# DropToken
<hr>
Welcome to DropToken! DropToken is a two-player terminal game. The rules of the game are simple; two players take turns dropping token into one of four columns. The first player with 4 tokens in a row wins!

### How to start playing
Once you have cloned DropToken, navigate to the 'src' folder and run `javac game_code/DropToken.java` to compile the game. Then, run `java game_code.DropToken` to start playing! 

The game takes four commands: `GET` will show all the moves played thus far, `PUT #`, where # is a number 1-4, will put a token in one of the columns, `BOARD` will show the current board, and `EXIT` will end the game. 

Have fun playing!
